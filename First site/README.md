# WEBSITE

This README provides an overview of the code used in the website. It was developed by a beginner programmer in just two weeks, making it their first website development project. Despite being new to coding, they were able to create a responsive website that is usable on mobile and tablet devices.

## Code Overview

### JavaScript

The JavaScript code performs various functions on the website:

-   It handles the image modal functionality, allowing users to view images in a modal window when clicked.
-   The sidebar and menu icon functionality enable users to open and close the sidebar navigation.
-   The logo click event scrolls the page to the top.
-   It includes functions to close the modal window and sidebar when clicking outside or on the close button.

### CSS

The CSS code provides styling for the website and ensures its responsiveness on different devices. Some key styles include:

-   Background color and image settings.
-   Text alignment, color, and font styles.
-   Styling for different sections of the website, such as characters, titles, captions, and menus.
-   Customized styles for specific elements, such as the logo, images, and modals.

## Remarks

This website is responsive and designed to be accessible and usable on various devices, including mobile and tablet. Despite being the developer's first project and completed within a short timeframe, they successfully implemented responsive design principles to ensure a consistent user experience across different screen sizes.

Please note that additional improvements and optimizations can be made to enhance the website further.
